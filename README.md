LTA Robot Swarm


The main objective of our project is to develop a lighter-than-air, autonomous drone that is versatile enough to accomplish these and other various tasks while remaining simple enough to be scaled up to a swarm. The primary goal for the first semester was to construct the drone prototype itself. Its primary task was to navigate a hallway in a disaster situation to guide people trapped inside to an exit. In the second semester, we implemented advanced functionality such as the camera and distance sensors on the system in order to have the capability to autonomously find its way to the exit and navigate complex environments, while projecting an arrow visible on the ground indicating the exit’s location. You can see the program of our system and the 3D design of the system.
